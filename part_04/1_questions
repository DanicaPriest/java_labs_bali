Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array? a collection of variables of the same type called by the same name.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
String[] cats = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array? an array with rows and columns.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
int[][] scores = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
String a = dogs[9]

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException? when a code asked for something that is larger than the length of the array

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
int sample = array[array.length - 2];

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java? 2^31-1 = 2147483647

9) What is a bubble sort? a way to sort ints in  an array

10) How does a bubble sort work? it compares 2 ints and them moves large ones to one end and small ones to the other

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
when you have data that doesn't fit into a table format. ex a bus schedule
{2,5,7}
{3,9}
{4,9,4}

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
 for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
System.out.println(i)}

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
int i = 0;
while (i < array.length){ System.out.println(i); i++;}

14) What is a queue?
a queue is an array that the variables have to be accessed in the order they are placed.
15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
put, get

16) What is a stack?
a stack is like a queue except instead of of the first item added going to the first position the first item is on the bottom and new items are placed before it.
17) What differentiates stacks and queues? queue- first item is in first position and stays there. stack- first item gets moved to the bottom when a new item is added.

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
to itterate through an array
19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
a framework that helps access arrays and lists

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
for (int j = 0; j <array[i].length; j++){}
}
21) What is a String? data that can not be used mathmatically or a  sequence of characters. its an object.

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings? String.length, String.substring() String.split();

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean? you can't change them like with int, you can just replace them.

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
javac MyClass.java
java fileClass arg1 arg2
