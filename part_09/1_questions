1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
 A byte stream access the file byte by byte. Character oriented streams use character encoding scheme.

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
InputStream, PrintStream, BufferedOutputStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
Reader, Writer FileReader

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
the file automatically closes when the try is exited so there is no need for a .close() at the end of the code.

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:
try (FileReader rs = new FileReader(oldfile);
        FileWriter ws = new FileWriter(newfile)
        )

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
an integer for each byte

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)

            java.io.*

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?
provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
it need Input stream to convert the bytes into characters.

11) What does the InputStreamReader do with it's byte stream argument?
converts it into characters and passes it to the BufferedReader

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
readLine reads the whole line of a string where read reads each character.

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"

BufferedReader buff = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("yucatan_cenotes.txt"))
