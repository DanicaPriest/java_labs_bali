1) What is the difference between the Thread and Runnable?
by extending Thread, each of your threads has a unique object associated with it,
whereas implementing Runnable, many threads can share the same object instance.

2) How do you start a thread using Runnable?
implements Runnable

3) How do you start a thread using Thread?
extends Thread

4) How do you get a thread's name?
Thread.currentThread()


5) What does the "synchronize()" method do?
it locks the object do no other threads can enter until its finished

6) What does the "join()" method do?
allows one thread to wait until another thread completes its execution.


7) What does the "sleep()" method do?
pauses the code for a set amount of time

8) What is the one method you must write if you're implementing the Runnable class?
run()

9) Should you create that same method if you're extending Thread?
yes

10) Why is multi-threading so cool?
it allows you to run programs during idle time of other programs and at the same time.
